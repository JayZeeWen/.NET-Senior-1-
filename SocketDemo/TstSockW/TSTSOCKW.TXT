Description of 'TestSocket' (TSTSOCKW.EXE)


1. Purpose of this app

TestSocket is a winsocket application. You can start clients or hosts as many as you want and send text or whole files. When creating you can also select protocol (TCP oder UDP) and port of course.


2. Installation

TestSocket consists of files TSTSOCKW.EXE and this file, TSTSOCKW.TXT. No registry entries are written and no files copied to the windows system directories. So all you have to do is to copy these two files in a directory and create a link to the application.


3. User interface

The main window of TestSocket consists of 3 panels. On the left side you can see all servers or clients started so far. On the right side you may view the protocol lines of the currently selected server/client or a detailed view of all servers/clients started so far, depending on what you have selected in the left panel. Downside above the status line you may discover a field to enter text. If active, there is a open connection in the currently selected thread and you can type in text which will be send if you type <enter>. Note that to send a line feed (CRLF) you have to type <enter> without any text typed in.

If you select a file to write received data to it will be shortened to size 0 right away after selection, so be very careful with this option or elsewhere some data may be lost.
